# Allegory
> AI-Native operating system for risk and insurance
> Insurance distribution with 80% lower costs
> Transforming insurance with machine intelligence

## What We Do

Allegory is an AI-native insurance distribution platform that automates the entire insurance lifecycle from customer acquisition to policy binding to claims processing at a fraction of traditional costs.

**The Problem:**
Selling $100M in insurance costs carriers $12-15M in operational expenses. That's 12-15¢ of every premium dollar spent on overhead, requiring 100-200 staff per $100M in sales.

**Our Solution:**
Same $100M in sales costs $4-5M with Allegory. Zero labour per transaction. Instant quotes. Immediate binding. Preventing accidents. Protecting customers.

## Why This Repo Exists

Until now, Allegory has been built entirely behind closed doors. 4,700+ commits of full-stack, AI-native insurance infrastructure—none of it public.

We believe in the power of open ecosystems. This repo is the first step in:
- Sharing the internal systems we've built
- Making parts of it reusable for other builders in regulated and AI-driven verticals
- Starting a real conversation about what should be open-source in insurance

---

## What We Might Open-Source

We're not here to dump code for the sake of it. We want to open things that help others ship better, faster, and more securely.

| Candidate | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| allegory-auth | JWT-based auth system with SOC-2 ready policies |
| allegory-terraform | Fully modular Terraform stack for multi-tenant SaaS |
| allegory-agent-ui | Lightweight React UI kit for agent workflows |
| allegory-llm-core | LLM-native orchestration framework for vertical AI products |
