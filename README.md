# Allegory

> **Insurance distribution with 80% lower costs**  
> Transforming insurance with machine intelligence

---

## What We Do

Allegory is an **AI-native insurance distribution platform** that automates the entire insurance lifecycle from customer acquisition to policy binding to claims processing at a fraction of traditional costs.

**The Problem:**  
Selling $100M in insurance costs carriers $12-15M in operational expenses. That's 12-15¢ of every premium dollar spent on overhead, requiring 100-200 staff per $100M in sales.

**Our Solution:**  
Same $100M in sales costs $4-5M with Allegory. Zero labour per transaction. Instant quotes. Immediate binding. Preventing accidents. Protecting customers.

### **AllegoryOS: AI-native infrastructure built for risk and insurance**

AllegoryOS is designed to transform complex operations from reactive to predictive, from manual to autonomous, from slow to instantaneous.

Our Infrastructure-as-Code provides immediate access to enterprise cloud with data sovereignty in 13 regions.

We have built an event-driven platform from scracth, keeping in mind the future of software will be managed by executable tokens.

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React 19, Context API, CSS Modules |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Serverless, Event-driven |
| **Infrastructure** | Terraform (IaC), AWS ECS/Fargate, Multi-region |
| **Database** | 100+ highly-scalable DynamoDB tables with Multi-tenant schemas |
| **AI/ML** | LLM/SLM for insurance, 20+ specialized AI agents |
| **Auth** | JWT, Custom IAM + Cognito hybrid |
| **Security** | SOC-2 design, VPCs, WAF, KMS, SSL/TLS |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions, Automated testing & deployment |
| **Languages** | 13 languages/dialects supported — EN, FR, ES, DE, NL, TR, CN|

### **Key Technical Achievements**

## Why This Repo Exists

Until now, Allegory has been built entirely behind closed doors. **4,700+ commits** of full-stack, AI-native insurance infrastructure—none of it public.

We believe in the power of open ecosystems. This repo is the first step in:

- Sharing the internal systems we've built
- Making parts of it reusable for other builders in regulated and AI-driven verticals
- Starting a real conversation about what *should* be open-source in insurance

---

## What We Might Open-Source

We're not here to dump code for the sake of it. We want to open things that help others ship better, faster, and more securely.

| Candidate | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `allegory-auth` | JWT-based auth system with SOC-2 ready policies |
| `allegory-terraform` | Fully modular Terraform stack for multi-tenant SaaS |
| `allegory-agent-ui` | Lightweight React UI kit for agent workflows |
| `allegory-llm-core` | LLM-native orchestration framework for vertical AI products |
| `allegory-ci-cd` | GitHub Actions templates for secure deployment to AWS |
| `allegory-insurance-agents` | Specialized AI agents for insurance operations |
